# [Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/sijujusi/The_Battle_of_Neighbourhoods) 
* Exploratory Data Analysis or (EDA) is understanding the data sets by summarizing their main characteristics often plotting them visually. This step is very important especially when we arrive at modeling the data in order to apply Machine learning. Plotting in EDA consists of Histograms, Box plot, Scatter plot and many more. It often takes much time to explore the data. Through the process of EDA, we can ask to define the problem statement or definition on our data set which is very important.

How to perform Exploratory Data Analysis ?
This is one such question that everyone is keen on knowing the answer. Well, the answer is it depends on the data set that you are working. There is no one method or common methods in order to perform EDA, whereas in this tutorial you can understand some common methods and plots that would be used in the EDA process.

What data are we exploring today ?
Since I am a huge fan of cars, I got a very beautiful data-set of cars from Kaggle. The data-set can be downloaded from here. To give a piece of brief information about the data set this data contains more of 10, 000 rows and more than 10 columns which contains features of the car such as Engine Fuel Type, Engine HP, Transmission Type, highway MPG, city MPG and many more. So in this tutorial, we will explore the data and make it ready for modeling.
