## [PROJECT 1: Exploratory Data Analysis- Car Features and Price](https://github.com/sijujusi/Car-Features-and-Price) 

### Project Overview:

* Read dataset containing 12000 car models sold between 1990 and 2018 in the USA. The dataset included 15 features and a price for each car sold.
* Flitered, cleaned and manipulated data to minimize outliers, empty values and duplicated.
* Generated insights by using several types of charts such as boxplot, barplot, piechart, scatter plot and heat maps.
* Identified features which impacts the price of a car the most.

## [PROJECT 2: Regression Analysis- Prediction of Car Price](https://github.com/sijujusi/Prediction-of-Car-Price-) 

### Project Overview:

* Read dataset containing 12000 car models sold between 1990 and 2018 in the USA. The dataset included 15 features and a price for each car sold.
* Flitered, cleaned and manipulated data to minimize outliers, empty values and duplicated.
* Filled missing values using mean and mode.
* Preprocessed data (one hot encoding and multi hot encoding for categorical features) and preparation for data for prediction
* Splitted data into training and testing sets
* Applied regression models such as Linear, Lasso, ridge, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree and Random Forest
* Compared results for different regression models
